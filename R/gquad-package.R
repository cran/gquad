#' gquad-package: A package for predicting G quadruplex motif(s)
#'
#' The gquad-package provides two funcions for  prediction: gquad and gquadO.
#' gquad predicts without including overlaps, while gquadO includes overlaps.
#' Nucleotide sequence can be provided in raw or fasta format or as GenBank accession number(s).
#' Internet is needed to connect to GenBank database, if accession number(s) is given as argument.
#' A dataframe of G quadruplex motif(s) position, sequence and length is returned.
#' If more than one nucleotide sequence is provided as argument, an input ID is returned for motif(s) predicted from each input sequence.
